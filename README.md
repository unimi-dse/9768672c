Teslasales Package
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction
The package contains a dataset of the Sales of Tesla Motorcars in five European Countries (Norw, Ned, Swi, Ger and UK).
The dataset is used for statistical purposes (data analysis, visualization, ecc.) and contains built-in functions for deeper examination of each task.

### Installation

    #Install the package by running the command:
    
    > devtools::install_github("unimi-dse/9768672c")
    
### Dataset

The packages contains a dataset from "Tesla Europe Registration Stats" (https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-europe-registration-stats.61651/) accuratley modified in order to highlight the most relevant data.

### Documentation ADD NEW FUNCTIONS!!!

      #To see the documentation of each function inside the package:
      
      > ?import_data()
        ?barplotly_func()
        ?ts_data()
        ?data_tsplotly()
        ?data_tracesl()
        ?stat_ts()
   
### Usage

      #load the package and run the function to recall the dataset
      > require('teslasales')
         import_data()
   
   Functions ADD NEW FUNCTIONS!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the functions includes arguments which, if not specified, will have as value the default one which is properly indicated inside the documentation, by typing: ?name_of_the_function().

### import_data()
The function import_data() allows to have the dataset in the global environment as a dataframe.

### barplotly_func()
The function barplotly_func() takes as arguments a df, a function to be applied, a character string for the name of the plot and two character strings for the name of both the x and y axis respectively. It gives as output the barplot itself generated using the package plotly.

### ts_data()
The function ts_data() creates a time series, using the R-package plotly, of an specified element (second argument) of a dataframe. It returns a class zoo element.

### data_tsplotly()
The function data_tsplotly() takes as arguments a df, a specified number which refers to the time series of the original dataset, a character string for the name of the plot and two others character strings for the name of both the x and y axis respectively. It returns a linechart of the time series generated by the R-package plotly.

### data_tracesl()
The function data_tracesl() takes as arguments a df, two specified numbers each referring to the time series of the original dataset, two character strings for the names of both the time series, another character string for the name of the plot and two others character strings for the name of both the x and y axis respectively.

### stat_ts()
The function stat_ts() takes as arguments a zoo class object (time series) and a character string or a vector of character string which refers to the statistic that will be applied to the object (ex. "correlation", "covariance", "partial"). It returns a basic plot of the statistic selected.


   Dependency with other R-packages ADD NEW PACKAGES!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   zoo: package for creating time series objects
-   na.tools: package useful to work with missing datavisualization (plotting)
-   RColorBrewer: package for customizing the colours of the plots
-   lubridate: package for convert date into quarterly
-   plotly: package used for data visualization (plotting)
-   magrittr: to improve readability and maintainability of code
-   dplyr: as grammar data manipulation
